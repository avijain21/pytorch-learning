    "### 🧠 Brain Analogy\n",
    "A radiologist spends 6 years in medical school learning general medicine, then 2 years specialising in reading X-rays. They don't re-learn anatomy — they **transfer** general knowledge to the new speciality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning works the same way:\n",
    "- **ImageNet pretraining** = medical school (1.2M images, 1000 classes, months of GPU time)\n",
    "- **Your fine-tuning** = specialisation (hundreds of your images, minutes to hours)\n",
    "- **Pretrained weights** = accumulated expertise: edges → shapes → textures → object parts\n",

    "The model already knows how to see. You just teach it YOUR specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Engineer Analogy\n",
    "ResNet-18 trained on ImageNet = a visual feature hierarchy producing rich 512-d embeddings for any image. Transfer learning: remove old head (1000 classes) → add new head (your N classes). Two strategies: Feature Extraction (freeze backbone, fast) or Fine-Tuning (partial unfreeze, more accurate).\n",

    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "- Loading pretrained ImageNet models from `torchvision.models`\n",
    "- Feature extraction (freeze backbone, train only head)\n",
    "- Fine-tuning (unfreeze layers progressively)\n",
    "- Differential learning rates (different LR for each layer group)\n",
    "- Grad-CAM — visualising what the model focuses on\n",

    "## Why Transfer Learning?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Training ResNet-50 from scratch on ImageNet:\n",
    "  → 1.2M images, ~90 GPU hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer Learning to your 1000-image dataset:\n",

    "\n",
    "Pretrained weights = millions of training hours of feature learning — already done for you!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Strategies\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Feature Extraction:  freeze ALL backbone layers → only train new head\n",
    "   Best when: your data is small & similar to ImageNet\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fine-Tuning:         unfreeze last N layers → train with small LR\n",
